SHORT TITLE is Phase2/3 study of Individualized Treatment for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Based on Biomarker EBV DNA. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Rupali Nabar. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is 18 Years and older   (Adult, Older Adult). DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:

Biopsy proven (from primary lesion and/or lymph nodes) diagnosis of cancer of the nasopharynx
Sites are required to complete Step 1 registration before submitting specimens for EBV DNA analysis.

Patients must have detectable pretreatment plasma EBV DNA, determined by the central lab prior to Step 2 registration (see Section 10.2 for details of specimen submission).
For patients who have detectable plasma EBV DNA tested at one of the credentialed central labs (listed on the EBV DNA Testing Specimen Transmittal form) within 28 days prior to Step 1 registration: that test result can be used for eligibility without the need for re-testing. To use this test result for eligibility, the central lab must enter the test result through the pathology portal, and the site must follow the instructions in Section 5.4.
Stage II-IVB disease (AJCC, 7th ed.) with no evidence of distant metastasis, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

History/physical examination by a Medical Oncologist or Clinical Oncologist or Radiation Oncologist or ENT, which must include an endoscopic evaluation, a complete list of current medications, and assessment of weight and weight loss in the past 6 months within 21 days prior to registration;
Evaluation of tumor extent required within 28 days prior to registration:
MRI of the nasopharynx and neck; or CT of the nasopharynx and neck with &#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and bone windows (to evaluate base of skull involvement).
Note: If a treatment planning CT scan is used, it must be with &#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and be read by a radiologist.

Exclusion Criteria:

Prior invasive malignancy (except node negative, non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 1095 days (3 years) (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible)
Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable; however, at least 6-weeks recovery is necessary if the last regimen included nitrosourea or mitomycin
Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields
Patients with hearing loss assessed to be primarily sensorineural in nature, requiring a hearing aid, or intervention (i.e. interfering in a clinically significant way with activities of daily living); a conductive hearing loss that is tumor-related is allowed
&#8805; Grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy (CTCAE, v. 4.0)
Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the completion of therapy and follow up or with full understanding of the risks and potential complications of the therapy
Unstable angina and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure within the past 6 months
Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months
Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; note that patients switched from IV antibiotics and currently on oral antibiotics whose infection is assessed to be adequately treated or controlled are eligible
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days prior to registration
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception. DESCRIPTION is There are two study questions we are asking in this randomized phase II/III trial based on a blood biomarker, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for locoregionally advanced non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. All patients will first undergo standard concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When this standard treatment is completed, if there is no detectable EBV DNA in their plasma, then patients are randomized to either standard adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy or observation. If there is still detectable levels of plasma EBV DNA, patients will be randomized to standard cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy versus gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and fluorouracil is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel after radiation therapy in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.. PHASE DESC is II/III. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is Treatment. AGE DESCRIPTION is Adults. SCOPE DESC is Local. MODIFIED DATE is 2022-01-06T22:40:08. DEPARTMENT NAME is CFCCC.

Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.. DESCRIPTION is UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be treated
by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently available.

Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and
new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. In order to conduct this research, we need
to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. In order
to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies
that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. In certain circumstances (blood
draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the
sample that would be collected for your routine care. Except for giving samples of blood, you will not be
asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. 

You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a
hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.

This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing.
It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their collaborators (including for-profit entities) may request permission to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.

These studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may
include the study of genetics, including the subject&#8217;s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole
genome sequencing. Samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines.

&#8226;	Phase 1: Phase 1 of this research study is currently ongoing. It was the first time that the study drug, reprotrectinib, was given to humans.
o	The purpose of Phase 1 was to determine the dose of repotrectinib to use in Phase 2 of the study.  Phase 1 look at the side effects and response of tumors to different doses of repotrectinib. Phase 1 also looked at how different foods affect how repotrectinib gets into the body. Phase 1 includes the following sub-studies:
&#61607;	Phase 1a, where the study drug is given under fasting conditions. You will need to fast 1 hour before and 2 hours after study drug administration. As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects
&#61607;	Phase 1b is a Food Effect Sub-Study (a study within a study). You may be asked to participate in the Food Effect Sub-Study. The purpose of the Food Effect Sub-Study is to determine the effect of high-fat, high-calorie food on a single dose of repotrectinib (how much and how fast repotrectinib gets into the body after a meal). As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects.
&#61607;	Phase 1 also includes a study of repotrectinib when administered continuously with food, where you will take every dose of the study drug with a standard meal, called Phase 1c. 
&#8226;	Phase 2: You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study (not Phase 1). The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine, more specifically, whether repotrectinib works, especially in groups of subjects who have the various tumor gene rearrangements mentioned above. Phase 2 will also continue to look at the side effects as well as how repotrectinib is absorbed into the body.
The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of repotrectinib at the dose listed below:
&#8226;	160 mg once a day for 14 days that may increase to 160 mg twice a day based on the drug&#8217;s tolerability 
The study doctor will assess and decide if your dose should be increased or decreased.

SHORT TITLE is Phase II/III, Circulating Tumor DNA as Predictive Biomarker in Adj Chemo in Pts w/Stage IIA Colon Ca. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Jason Zell. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is Adults. DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:
You must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
Histologically/pathologically confirmed stage IIA adenocarcinoma of the colon (T3, N0, M0) with at least 12 lymph nodes examined at the time of surgical resection.
Appropriate for active surveillance (i.e., no adjuvant chemotherapy) at the discretion of and as documented by the evaluating oncologist based on current practice patterns.
The distal extent of the tumor must be >= 12 cm from the anal verge on pre-surgical endoscopy (i.e., excluding rectal adenocarcinomas warranting treatment with chemoradiation). If the patient did not undergo a pre-surgical endoscopy, then the distal extent of the tumor must be >= 12 cm from the anal verge as determined by surgical examination or pre-operative imaging.
You must have had an en bloc complete gross resection of tumor (curative resection) as definitive surgical cancer treatment within 14 to 60 days of study randomization. Patients who have had a two-stage surgical procedure to first provide a decompressive colostomy and then, in a later procedure, to have the definitive surgical resection, are eligible.
Availability and provision of adequate surgical tumor tissue for molecular diagnostics and confirmatory profiling.

Exclusion Criteria:
Colon cancer histology other than adenocarcinoma (i.e., neuroendocrine carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.).
Pathologic, clinical, or radiologic evidence of overt metastatic disease. This includes isolated, distant, or non-contiguous intra-abdominal metastases, even if resected (including the presence of satellite nodules constituting N1c disease in the absence of lymph node involvement).
Tumor-related bowel perforation.
History of prior invasive colon malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval.
History of organ transplantation.
Any prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy; or radiation therapy administered as treatment for colorectal cancer (e.g., primary rectal adenocarcinomas for which treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation is warranted are not permitted).
Other invasive malignancy within 5 years before randomization. Exceptions are colonic polyps, non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ including those of the cervix and breast (DCIS).
Synchronous primary rectal and/or colon cancers.
Antineoplastic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy) within 5 years before randomization. (For the purposes of this study, hormonal therapy is not considered chemotherapy.).. DESCRIPTION is This phase II/III trial studies how well circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) testing in the blood works in predicting treatment for patients with stage IIA colon cancer after surgery. ctDNA are circulating tumor cells that are shed by tumors into the blood. Finding ctDNA in the blood means that there is very likely some small amounts of cancer that remain after surgery. However, this cancer, if detected, cannot be found on other tests usually used to find cancer, as it is too small. Testing for ctDNA levels may help identify patients with colon cancer after surgery who do benefit, and those who do not benefit, from receiving chemotherapy.

DESCRIPTION is This phase II trial studies how well lower-dose chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) therapy works in comparison to standard-dose chemoradiation in treating patients with early-stage anal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This study may help doctors find out if lower-dose chemoradiation is as effective and has fewer side effects than standard-dose chemoradiation, which is the usual approach for treatment of this cancer type..

-HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required
* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
-Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
-Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
-Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
-The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis

Exclusion Requirements.
You cannot participate in this study if you
- are pregnant or breast-feeding. DESCRIPTION is This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.. PHASE DESC is III. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is Treatment.

- Pathologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of prostate cancer within 180 days prior to registration
- The patient must agree to use a condom (even men with vasectomies) and another effective method of birth control if he is having sex with a woman of childbearing potential or agree to use a condom if he is having sex with a woman who is pregnant while on study drug and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug

Exclusion Criteria: 
- Prior systemic chemotherapy within =< 3 years prior to registration; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowed (completed > 3 years prior to registration)
- Prior radical prostatectomy
- Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields. DESCRIPTION is This phase III trial compares less intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer and low gene risk score. This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score..

SHORT TITLE is Optimal Perioperative Therapy for Incidental Gallbladder Cancer (OPT-IN): A Randomized Phase II/III . INVESTIGATOR NAME is Zeljka Jutric. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is Adults. DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Eligibility Criteria:

-Patients must be 18 years of age or older
-Patients must have confirmed T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer discovered incidentally at the time of or following routine cholecystectomy for presumed benign disease.
-Patients must have undergone initial cholecystectomy within 12 weeks. DESCRIPTION is This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach..

DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:
- Male or female >= 18 years of age at the time of informed consent
- Patient can comprehend and sign the study informed consent form
- No prior systemic therapy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting

Exclusion Criteria:
- Active infection requiring infusional treatment
- Major surgery requiring general anesthesia =< 14 days before first dose of protocol-indicated treatment
- Inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 160/90 mmHg). DESCRIPTION is This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are "immunotherapies" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a "targeted therapy" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond..

TITLE is Randomized Phase II Trial of Encorafenib and Cetuximab with or without Nivolumab (NSC #748726) for Patients with Previously Treated, Microsatellite Stable, BRAFV600E Metastatic and/or Unresectable Colorectal Cancer. SHORT TITLE is Ph II Trial Encorafenib Cetuximab w/or w/out Nivolumab Pts PreviouslyTreated MicrosatelliteBRAFV600E. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Jennifer Brooke Valerin. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is Adults. DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:
You must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. The date of diagnosis will be determined according to the pathologic date of diagnosis
You must have measurable disease according to RECIST1.1 criteria. Computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) used to assess measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. CT scans or MRIs used to assess non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have documented unresectable and/or metastatic disease on CT or MRI imaging. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have BRAF^V600E mutated colorectal cancer as tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory
You must have proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS) status as tested in a CLIA-certified laboratory and documented by the treating clinician. Proficient mismatch repair status can be determined by intact expression by immunohistochemistry of all 4 mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2). Microsatellite instability can be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Exclusion Criteria:
You must not have a known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction
You must not have had prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including, but not limited to, encorafenib, dabrafenib, or vemurafenib), MEK inhibitor (including, but not limited to, trametinib, selumetinib, or binimetinib), or ERK inhibitor (of note, regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the context of eligibility criteria)
You must not have had prior treatment with anti-EGFR therapies
You must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways. DESCRIPTION is This phase II trial tests whether adding nivolumab to the usual treatment (encorafenib and cetuximab) works better than the usual treatment alone to shrink tumors in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose tumor has a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

doctor will know.
You have not had major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first 
study dose.
You have not received any live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first study dose.. DESCRIPTION is Why are we doing this study and why have you been asked to take part?

We are asking you to join this study because you are suffering from cancer of the blood and bone 
marrow. In this study, we are looking at a new investigational drug called LYT-200 that is 
intended to inhibit (hinder) galectin-9. Galectin-9 is a protein which suppresses immune function
and disables immune-mediated attack on the cancer cells through multiple pathways. At present, 
there are no approved therapies targeting galectin-9 for any disease. Early studies conducted in 
animals suggest LYT-200 might be a good treatment for patients with blood and bone marrow 
cancer.
This study is among the first research studies of LYT-200 in people and its main purpose is to 
test its safety and tolerability in patients suffering from two types of blood and bone marrow 
cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we 
shall also examine how the drug is changed by and removed from the body and will look for

7.  Unable to speak or read English sufficiently to complete informed consent
8.  Any other criteria, which would make the patient unsuitable to participate in this study as determined by the study staff (e.g., an uncontrolled drug and/or alcohol addiction). DESCRIPTION is This home-based randomized clinical trial is designed to test the efficacy of ZA-5 mg in Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism patients. This trial will also address barriers to treatment of patients with PD and parkinsonism by providing rigorous evidence about whether ZA reduces fracture risk in patients with PD and parkinsonism, simplifying treatment by giving ZA at home without extra medical visits and BMD testing, and overcoming poor persistence with oral therapies because one infusion may prevent bone loss for at least 2 years. The outcome of this trial will demonstrate how a home-based fracture prevention can reach older PD patients who would not otherwise receive treatment to reduce their high risk of fractures.

Patients with PD will be recruited throughout the US by participating neurologists and health networks as well as the Parkinson's Foundation. Patients may also self-refer to the study. Interested patients can access study information on a study website (topaz.eurekaplatform.org) as well as through the Parkinson's Foundation Helpline. Patients who wish to enroll will be directed to an interactive electronic consent (eConsent). Following eConsent, participants complete a screening questionnaire (to confirm eligibility), followed by a baseline questionnaire. If a participant is determined to be eligible following these steps, they may be scheduled for a Telemedicine assessment to further confirm the PD or parkinsonism diagnosis, unless they have been referred directly from a participating neurologist. If confirmed, the participant will be mailed a supply of vitamin D3 800-1000 IU and instructed to take one vitamin D tablet every day for 2 months. Lastly, a Nurse Home Visit will be scheduled and conducted to confirm final eligibility, randomization, and administration of the study drug, if appropriate. Participants who are randomized will be contacted every 4 months for at least 2 years to determine if they have had any fractures.. PHASE DESC is IV. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is INT - Drug.

Huntington's Disease. DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Study Population:
Patients with HD and their family members are recruited from specialty clinics (Human Genetics, Neurology, Psychiatry) that advise and treat people affected by HD. In addition, in some areas community clinics and neurologists who see HD patients recruit participants for this study. Participants also receive information about the study through websites, clinical practices, support groups, advocacy newsletters, etc. and place a direct request to be considered for participation in the study. Community controls are identified by study site staff (using advertisements, flyers and newsletters) with the support of the Enroll-HD operational staff.

Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Carriers: This group comprises the primary study population and consists of individuals who carry the HD gene expansion mutation.
2.  Controls: This group comprises the comparator study population and consists of individuals who do not carry the HD expansion mutation.
3.  These two major categories can be further subdivided into six different subgroups of eligible individuals:
4.  Manifest/Motor-manifest HD: Carriers with clinical features that are regarded in the opinion of the investigator as diagnostic of HD.
5.  Pre-Manifest/-Motor-manifest HD: Carriers without clinical features regarded as diagnostic of HD.
6.  Genotype Unknown: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has not undergone predictive testing for HD and therefore has an undetermined carrier status.
7.  Genotype Negative: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has undergone predictive testing for HD and is known not to carry the HD expansion mutation.
8.  Family Control: Family members or individuals not related by blood to carriers (e.g., spouses, partners, caregivers).
9.  Community Controls: Individuals unrelated to HD carriers who did not grow up in a family affected by HD. Data collected from community controls will be used for generation of normative data for sub-studies.
10.  Participant status will be captured in the study database using 2 variables: 1) Investigator Determined Status: this will be based on clinical signs and symptoms and genotyping performed as part of medical care, and will be updated at every visit; and 2) Research Genotyping Status: this will be based on genotyping conducted as part of Enroll-HD study procedures. Based on research genotyping, participants will be reclassified under this variable from Genotype Unknown to 'Carriers' or 'Controls'.

. DESCRIPTION is Prevention of stroke involves managing and treating risk factors. Most strokes are caused when blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked. One place this often happens is in the carotid artery. This blockage is called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.

The purpose of this trial is to determine the best way to prevent strokes in people who have a high amount of blockage of their carotid artery but no stroke symptoms related to that blockage. Each eligible participant will be evaluated to determine which procedure(s) is best for him/her. All participants will receive intensive medical treatment. In addition, participants will be randomized to receive the selected procedure or not.

The trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada by physicians carefully selected on their ability to perform the procedures at low risk. Another key component of the trial is that important stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, physical activity, and diet will be managed intensively. Participants will remain in the study for 4 years.. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is INT - Device. AGE DESCRIPTION is Adults. SCOPE DESC is National. MODIFIED DATE is 2023-03-29T12:53:30.

2.  These criteria are subject to change with the needs of the registry at the sole discretion of the Sponsor (Corrona).. DESCRIPTION is The objective of the Corrona Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Registry is to create a national cohort of patients with IBD. The diseases under study include Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications approved for the treatment of IBD. This will be done through the standardized collection of validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events, medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.

The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with IBD under the care of a certified gastroenterologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected from both patients and their treating gastroenterologist during routine clinical encounters using Corrona registry questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments for IBD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes.

After the enrollment visit, IBD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month period.

Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is OBS - Plus drug/device/survey.

This protocol is also designed to collect and evaluate the safety and clinical performance of NexoBrid in patients suffering from DPT and FT thermal burns.

Following the enrollment of a patient to the protocol, physicians will identify one or more target wounds (TWs) per patient according to the TW definition. All patient's DPT and FT burns that comply with the specified entrance criteria will be treated with NexoBrid and, therefore, must be designated as TWs. This will further allow an evaluation of the patient's systemic safety by allowing treatment of the patient's entire deep burns.

Prior to initiation of eschar removal treatment, patients will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions according to product instruction for use in order to ensure clean and moist eschar covered wound bed for NexoBrid application. Vital signs (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and temperature) measurements and pain assessment will be performed within 24 hrs before start of treatment as well as haematology, biochemistry blood tests & PTT/INR. Pressure measurements for circumferential extremity wounds will be performed 1 hour before start of treatment and will be closely monitored during treatment. Following wound cleansing and soaking treatments, patients will undergo the eschar removal process. TWs of up to 15% total body surface area (TBSA) will be treated with a single application of NexoBrid for 4 hours. Patients with TWs >15% TBSA and up to 30% TBSA will be treated with 2 consecutive applications of 4 hours each. NexoBrid should not be applied to more than 15% TBSA in one session. PK samples will be taken from sub-set of patients with TWs area >15% TBSA. Pressure measurements for circumferential extremity wounds will be performed after the removal of NexoBrid.

Post eschar removal completion, patients will undergo daily vital signs (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and temperature measurements) and pain assessments for 1 week, starting on the morning following start of eschar removal. Blood tests (haematology and biochemistry) will be performed 24 ± 6 hrs post eschar removal as well as PTT/INR.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Non-ambulatory at the time of enrollment.
2.  Any other illness that would interfere with the ability to undergo safe testing or would interfere with interpretation of the results in the opinion of the site investigator.. DESCRIPTION is The genetic heterogeneity has been a barrier to broad natural history efforts, with prior investigations often limited to single gene mutations. Much attention is paid to the variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear, is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity and represent a large unmet clinical need.

Recent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of the LGMD mutations. Several of these gene replacement therapies are currently in pre-clinical/phase 1 testing, leading to an urgent need for natural history data. In addition, non-specific therapies which target muscle mass or function are being tested in other muscular dystrophies and may prove beneficial for LGMD..

This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 2/3 study of patients age 12 to 65 years (inclusive), with sickle cell disease. There are two planned interim analyses in this study design. Initially, patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 to one of two dose levels of etavopivat or placebo. At the first interim analysis, one of the two etavopivat dose levels will be selected for the Phase 3 portion of the study, in which patients will be randomized at 1:1 to the selected etavopivat dose or placebo. Efficacy on hemoglobin will be evaluated at the second interim analysis, and then will be tested along with evaluation of efficacy on vaso-occlusive crises at the final analysis. Following completion of 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients may enter a 52-week etavopivat open-label extension period.. PHASE DESC is II/III. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is Treatment.

SHORT TITLE is Eval of pancreatic cystic lesions via EUS-guided fine needle aspiration w/ and w/o micro forceps. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Jason Samarasena. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is 18 Years to 89 Years   (Adult, Older Adult). DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Adult patients >18 years old
2.  Cysts > 20 mm in size deemed appropriate for FNA by the endoscopist, based on clinical presentation, radiologic imaging features, associated solid mass or nodules, and patient anxiety about the diagnosis

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Age <18 years
2.  Inability to provide informed consent
3.  Thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 50,000) or coagulopathy (INR > 1.8)
4.  Pregnancy
5.  Post-surgical anatomy where the cyst is not accessible for FNA
6.  EUS findings suggesting that cyst FNA would be unsafe (e.g. intervening blood vessels)
7.  EUS appearance suggesting FNA is not indicated (e.g. cyst smaller than prior radiologic imaging, cyst not seen, EUS suggestive of serous cystadenoma). DESCRIPTION is Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are a common incidental finding in cross sectional imaging (up to 27% on CT scan and 41% on MRI) and pose a management challenge to physicians. According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration) and sent for fluid analysis (CEA and amylase) and cytology. However, despite use of a cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level cutoff of 192 ng/mL and cytology, accuracy of diagnosis for PCLs is poor. As the spectrum ranges from benign to high risk for neoplasm, precise diagnosis is critical. More recently, the adjunctive use of the Moray® through the needle microforceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a microforceps through a 19-guage needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. Pancreatic cysts continue to pose a management dilemma for practicing clinicians, especially with the increased use of radiologic imaging modalities identifying incidental pancreatic cystic lesions with higher frequency. This leads to patient anxiety and increased costs due to radiologic surveillance and even surgery. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is INT - Device.

200. TITLE is New IDEAS: Imaging Dementia Evidence for Amyloid Scanning Study A Study to Improve Precision in Amyloid PET Coverage and Patient Care. SHORT TITLE is Study to Improve Precision in Amyloid PET Coverage and Patient Care. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Seyed Ahmad Sajjadi. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is 18 Years and older   (Adult, Older Adult). DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria:

Medicare beneficiary with Medicare as primary insurance;
Meets clinical criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Dementia as defined by the 2018 National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association Research Framework
Brain MRI and/or CT within 24 months prior to enrollment;
Clinical laboratory assessment (complete blood count [CBC], standard blood chemistry profile, thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], vitamin B12) within the 12 months prior to enrollment;
Able to tolerate amyloid PET required by protocol, to be performed at a participating PET facility;
English or Spanish speaking (for the purposes of informed consent);
Willing and able to provide consent. Consent may be by proxy;
Neuropsychiatric syndrome can be classified into "clinically typical" or "clinically atypical" categories
Exclusion Criteria:

Normal cognition or subjective complaints that are not verified by cognitive testing or key informant.
Knowledge of amyloid status, in the opinion of the referring dementia expert, may cause significant psychological harm or otherwise negatively impact the patient or family.
Amyloid status already known to patient or referring clinician based on prior amyloid imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
Current or previous enrollment in an anti-amyloid therapeutic trial.
Scan is being ordered solely based on a family history of dementia, presence of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4, or in lieu of genotyping for suspected autosomal mutation carriers.
Scan being ordered for nonmedical purposes (e.g., legal, insurance coverage, or employment screening).
Cancer requiring active therapy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).
Hip/pelvic fracture within the 12 months prior to enrollment.
Body weight exceeds PET scanner weight limit.
Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant within 90 days of registration.
Life expectancy less than 24 months based on medical co-morbidities.
Residence in a skilled nursing facility (assisted living facility is not an exclusion criterion).. DESCRIPTION is A total of 7,000 Medicare beneficiaries meeting the study's eligibility criteria will be consented and enrolled over 30 months at sites throughout the United States. To ensure diversity, the study will enroll at least 2,000 Blacks/African Americans, at least 2,000 Latinos/Hispanics, and up to 3,000 additional participants from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on disease stage prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having MCI or dementia as their disease stage. Based on their clinical presentation prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having "typical" (i.e. progressive amnestic) or "atypical" clinical presentations of AD as the potential cause of dementia or MCI.

Dementia specialists will team with PET facilities that have trained radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and access to perform amyloid PET. All participating physicians and study staff will complete comprehensive training to ensure adherence of data requirements and study timelines. Amyloid PET will be performed and interpreted at each facility with results provided to the ordering dementia specialist for support in further decision making. The dementia specialists will record their diagnosis and intended management plan based on the current clinical and diagnostic information, and assuming no future access to amyloid PET at the "Pre-PET visit." This represents a "thought experiment" documenting the management plan that would be recommended by the specialist if the participant were not enrolling in New IDEAS and thus had no access to amyloid PET. PET results will be disclosed to patients and any consequent changes in management (if any) will be recommended at the "PET disclosure visit." Patients will return 90 ± 30 days following PET for an in person "Post-PET visit." At this final visit, the dementia specialists will record the diagnosis and implemented management plan, incorporating amyloid PET into clinical decision making. Medicare claims data will be collected directly from CMS for 12 months prior to the PET imaging and 12 months after the PET imaging, for each participant.

Aim 1 utilizes Medicare claims data to compare 12-month claims-derived outcomes in amyloid PET-positive versus amyloid PET-negative individuals with MCI and dementia across the entire cohort. Aims 2 and 3 investigate these associations in sub-groups of study participants based on self-identified race and ethnicity (Aim 2) and clinical presentation (Aim 3). Aims 2 and 3 additionally evaluate changes in management between the pre- and post-PET visits in the relevant sub-groups, to test whether benefits in health outcomes are mediated by changes in clinical management. The investigator's over-arching hypothesis, supported by preliminary data from the first IDEAS study, is that amyloid PET results will be associated with changes in clinical management, which in turn will translate into improved health outcomes in patients with amyloid PET-positive scans in comparison with patients with amyloid PET-negative scans. We further hypothesize that these effects will be seen across patients of different ethnoracial backgrounds, clinical presentations and disease stages (MCI and dementia).

Optional components of the study include the collection and archival of participant's amyloid PET images, and blood plasma. These repositories will serve as a resource to the field, enabling the testing and validation of emerging genetic and blood biomarkers. Separate consent will be obtained for participation in these components.. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is OBS - Plus drug/device/survey. AGE DESCRIPTION is Adults. SCOPE DESC is National.

DESCRIPTION is This double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three different dose levels of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS.

Approximately 216 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into one of 4 groups using a computer generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization will be first stratified by gender (male or female) and then by risk for organ failure in the gender subgroups (higher or lower). Higher risk for organ failure is defined by the presence of both an elevated hematocrit (HCT &#8805;44% for men or &#8805;40% for women) and hypoxemia (imputed PaO2/FiO2 &#8804;360). Lower risk for organ failure is defined by the absence of either or both an elevated hematocrit and hypoxemia. The PaO2/FiO2 will be determined using an arterial blood gas or imputed using pulse oximetry.

All patients will have received a Screening CECT of the abdomen/pancreas before being randomized into the study. CECTs performed as standard of care may be used as the Screening CECT but must have been performed in the 24 hours before Consent or after Consent and before Randomization.

The Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur within 8 hours of the patient or LAR providing informed consent. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 1.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 3 will receive 0.5 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 4 will receive emulsion without any active pharmaceutical ingredient. Patients in Group 4 will receive one of three randomly assigned dose volumes, 1.25 mL/kg, 0.625 mL/kg, or 0.3125 mL/kg, which will be administered intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of hospitalization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, the upper limit of the volume of Auxora and volume of Placebo that will be administered will be 156.25 mL. The sponsor, investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. In the event of a medical emergency, investigators will be able to receive the treatment assignment if required to provide optimal care of the patient.

For all 4 groups, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform assessments at screening, at the baseline assessment, immediately prior to the SFISD, and then every 24 hours until 240 hours after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. If patients remain hospitalized at Day 12, assessments will then be performed every 48 hours starting on Day 12 until Day 28, or until discharge if earlier. Patients discharged from the hospital before Day 25 will return at Day 30 (+5 days) to perform the Day 30 assessments. If patients are discharged on Days 25-29, the Day 30 assessments may be performed prior to discharge.

Patients will receive another CECT of the abdomen/pancreas at the Day 30 (±5 days) visit. All CECTs performed as standard of care after randomization and before the Day 30 CECT will also be captured. A blinded central reader will read the Screening, Day 30, and any standard of care CECTs obtained between randomization and the Day 30 visit.

Note: Concurrent participation in another observational registry or open-label Phase 3b/4 trial is allowed. (All serology types (APQ4 +/- and MOG +/-) are eligible to enroll in the registry given they meet the 2015 IPND diagnostic criteria.). DESCRIPTION is The objective of the registry is to create a cohort of patients with NMOSD. Data collected will be used to prospectively study the natural history of NMOSD, real-word effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat NMOSD, and drug utilization treatment patterns. Additionally, the data will be used to systematically evaluate the burden for patients with NMOSD and the impact of therapies on quality of life. This will be done through real time capture and adjudication of relapses, the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns.

Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry patient allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of NMOSD for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and patient adherence.

Consent for additional ad hoc surveys will be solicited which can allow evaluation of additional aspects of the disease impact such as care giver burden or impact of disease on productivity..

. DESCRIPTION is N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, ~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as "second-line" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome..

Exclusion Criteria:

1.  Has a juvenile myositis diagnosis and now >=18 years old

4.  Has a history of primary immunodeficiency or secondary immunodeficiency not related to the treatment of the participants IIM
5.  Has experienced myocardial infarction (MI), unstable ischemic heart disease, or stroke within 12 weeks of screening. DESCRIPTION is IIM is considered as a group of rare diseases that is characterized by common features of insidious painless, proximal skeletal muscle weakness, low endurance, and elevated serum muscle enzyme levels. Due to muscle weakness and progressive muscular atrophy, decreasing endurance, internal organ involvement (mainly given the pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations) and limited therapeutic options, IIM often leads to physical disability and decreased quality of life. Nipocalimab is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to selectively bind, saturate, and block the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding site on the endogenous neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) that binds, salvages, and recycles IgG into circulation or transport IgG across the placenta, following nonspecific pinocytosis into endothelial cells and cells of the reticuloendothelial system. At homeostasis, FcRn recycles IgG to maintain serum IgG levels and extend IgG half-life and also regulates immune cell inflammatory responses to IgG complexes. By targeting the IgG binding site on FcRn, nipocalimab is expected to block the binding and, hence, recycling of IgG, resulting in a decrease in circulating IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic IgG autoantibodies and alloantibodies. Therefore, nipocalimab has potential in the treatment of active IIM by decreasing pathogenic IgG antibody concentrations. The total duration of the study is up to 112 weeks, consisting of 4 study periods: a less than or equal to (<=) 6-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind period, a 48-week long term extension (LTE), and a safety follow-up 8 weeks post last administration of study intervention. Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry, including lipid panel), vital signs, and physical examination..

DESCRIPTION is AV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.

DESCRIPTION is RGX-314 is being developed as a novel one-time gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time. RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD..

Received a maximum cumulative dose of corticosteroids of >=140 mg of prednisone or equivalent within 14 days prior to randomization. DESCRIPTION is Multiple myeloma is an incurable, malignant, plasma cell disorder. Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that teclistamab monotherapy (Arm A) will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with investigator's choice of PVd or Kd (Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide. The study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, neurologic examinations, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and AE monitoring. The overall duration of the study will be up to 9 years.. PHASE DESC is III. TREATMENT TYPE DESC is Treatment. AGE DESCRIPTION is Adults. SCOPE DESC is National. MODIFIED DATE is 2023-05-26T16:43:31.

257. TITLE is A Phase I Clinical Trial of CA-4948 in Combination with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Metastatic or Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma. SHORT TITLE is Ph I CA-4948 in Comb w/ Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Meta or UnresePancreatic Ductal Carcinoma. INVESTIGATOR NAME is Farshid Dayyani. STATUS is OPEN TO ACCRUAL. ELIGIBILITY is Adult. DETAILED ELIGIBILITY is Inclusion Criteria

-Adults 18 years of age or older
-Patients with  confirmed adenocarcimona of the pancreas that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measure do not exist or are no longer effective.

Exclusion Criteria

-Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study
-Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents
-Patients who are pregnant. DESCRIPTION is This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of emavusertib (CA-4948) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Giving CA-4948 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may shrink or stabilize metastatic or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.. PHASE DESC is I.

3.  Between 6 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days project estimated gestational age (EGA) at first study visit.
4.  Intend to deliver at a participating hospital.

Exclusion Criteria:

1.  Participant age <13 years.
2.  History of 3 or more spontaneous abortions.
3.  Fetal malformation evident at or before enrollment that is likely lethal (e.g., anencephaly, hydrops, diffuse subcutaneous edema or cystic hygroma, ectopic cordis, encephalocele).

9.  Planned pregnancy termination.
10.  Unable to provide informed consent.. DESCRIPTION is The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study women for whom the current pregnancy will lead to their first delivery (nulliparas). About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.

The study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

The goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

Eight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes..
