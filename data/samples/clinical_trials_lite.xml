    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:

Biopsy proven (from primary lesion and/or lymph nodes) diagnosis of cancer of the nasopharynx
Sites are required to complete Step 1 registration before submitting specimens for EBV DNA analysis.

Patients must have detectable pretreatment plasma EBV DNA, determined by the central lab prior to Step 2 registration (see Section 10.2 for details of specimen submission).
For patients who have detectable plasma EBV DNA tested at one of the credentialed central labs (listed on the EBV DNA Testing Specimen Transmittal form) within 28 days prior to Step 1 registration: that test result can be used for eligibility without the need for re-testing. To use this test result for eligibility, the central lab must enter the test result through the pathology portal, and the site must follow the instructions in Section 5.4.
Stage II-IVB disease (AJCC, 7th ed.) with no evidence of distant metastasis, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

History/physical examination by a Medical Oncologist or Clinical Oncologist or Radiation Oncologist or ENT, which must include an endoscopic evaluation, a complete list of current medications, and assessment of weight and weight loss in the past 6 months within 21 days prior to registration;
Evaluation of tumor extent required within 28 days prior to registration:
MRI of the nasopharynx and neck; or CT of the nasopharynx and neck with &amp;#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and bone windows (to evaluate base of skull involvement).
Note: If a treatment planning CT scan is used, it must be with &amp;#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and be read by a radiologist.

Exclusion Criteria:

Prior invasive malignancy (except node negative, non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 1095 days (3 years) (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible)
Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable; however, at least 6-weeks recovery is necessary if the last regimen included nitrosourea or mitomycin
Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields
Patients with hearing loss assessed to be primarily sensorineural in nature, requiring a hearing aid, or intervention (i.e. interfering in a clinically significant way with activities of daily living); a conductive hearing loss that is tumor-related is allowed
&amp;#8805; Grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy (CTCAE, v. 4.0)
Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the completion of therapy and follow up or with full understanding of the risks and potential complications of the therapy
Unstable angina and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure within the past 6 months
Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months
Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; note that patients switched from IV antibiotics and currently on oral antibiotics whose infection is assessed to be adequately treated or controlled are eligible
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days prior to registration
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>There are two study questions we are asking in this randomized phase II/III trial based on a blood biomarker, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for locoregionally advanced non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. All patients will first undergo standard concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When this standard treatment is completed, if there is no detectable EBV DNA in their plasma, then patients are randomized to either standard adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy or observation. If there is still detectable levels of plasma EBV DNA, patients will be randomized to standard cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy versus gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and fluorouracil is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel after radiation therapy in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be treated
by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently available.

Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and
new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. In order to conduct this research, we need
to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. In order
to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies
that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. In certain circumstances (blood
draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the
sample that would be collected for your routine care. Except for giving samples of blood, you will not be
asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. 

You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a
hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.

This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing.
It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their collaborators (including for-profit entities) may request permission to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.

These studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may
include the study of genetics, including the subject&amp;#8217;s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole
genome sequencing. Samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you 
&amp;#8226;	Are a male or female subject, 18 years of age or older 
&amp;#8226;	Are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements
&amp;#8226;	Have a confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that has a specific gene rearrangement

Exclusion Requirements 
You cannot participate in this study if you
&amp;#8226;	Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study 
&amp;#8226;	Are currently participating in another therapeutic clinical trial
&amp;#8226;	Have a known active infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study has 2 parts (Phase 1 and Phase 2): 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 1: Phase 1 of this research study is currently ongoing. It was the first time that the study drug, reprotrectinib, was given to humans.
o	The purpose of Phase 1 was to determine the dose of repotrectinib to use in Phase 2 of the study.  Phase 1 look at the side effects and response of tumors to different doses of repotrectinib. Phase 1 also looked at how different foods affect how repotrectinib gets into the body. Phase 1 includes the following sub-studies:
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1a, where the study drug is given under fasting conditions. You will need to fast 1 hour before and 2 hours after study drug administration. As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1b is a Food Effect Sub-Study (a study within a study). You may be asked to participate in the Food Effect Sub-Study. The purpose of the Food Effect Sub-Study is to determine the effect of high-fat, high-calorie food on a single dose of repotrectinib (how much and how fast repotrectinib gets into the body after a meal). As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects.
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1 also includes a study of repotrectinib when administered continuously with food, where you will take every dose of the study drug with a standard meal, called Phase 1c. 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 2: You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study (not Phase 1). The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine, more specifically, whether repotrectinib works, especially in groups of subjects who have the various tumor gene rearrangements mentioned above. Phase 2 will also continue to look at the side effects as well as how repotrectinib is absorbed into the body.
The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of repotrectinib at the dose listed below:
&amp;#8226;	160 mg once a day for 14 days that may increase to 160 mg twice a day based on the drug&amp;#8217;s tolerability 
The study doctor will assess and decide if your dose should be increased or decreased.
 No study procedures related to this study will be performed until you have signed this Informed Consent Form. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be given to you to keep.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Key Inclusion Criteria:

For Phase 1:

Participants with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that:
Has progressed on or is intolerant to standard therapy, or
For which no standard therapy exists, or in the opinion of the Investigator, are not candidates for or would be unlikely to tolerate or derive significant clinical benefit from standard therapy, or
Decline standard therapy
Prior multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with anti-RET activity are allowed
A RET gene alteration is not required initially. Once adequate PK exposure is achieved, evidence of RET gene alteration in tumor and/or blood is required as identified through molecular assays, as performed for clinical evaluation
Measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO as appropriate to tumor type
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0, 1, or 2 or Lansky Performance Score (LPS) greater than or equal to (&amp;#8805;) 40 percent (%) (age less than [&lt;] 16 years) with no sudden deterioration 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment
Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
Life expectancy of at least 3 months
For Phase 2: As for phase 1 with the following modifications:

For Cohort 1: Participants must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease, or in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinical benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy
Cohorts 1 and 2:

Enrollment will be restricted to participants with evidence of a RET gene alteration in tumor
At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO, as appropriate to tumor type and not previously irradiated
Cohorts 3 and 4: Enrollment closed
Cohort 5:

Without measurable disease but otherwise meet criteria for Cohorts 1 and 2;
MTC syndrome spectrum cancers (e.g., MTC, pheochromocytoma), cancers with neuroendocrine features/differentiation, or poorly differentiated thyroid cancers with other RET alteration/activation may be allowed with prior Sponsor approval;
cfDNA positive for a RET gene alteration not known to be present in a tumor sample
Cohort 6: Participants who otherwise are eligible for Cohorts 1, 2 or 5 who discontinued another RET inhibitor due to intolerance may be eligible with prior Sponsor approval
Cohort 7: Participants must have a histologically confirmed stage IB-IIIA NSCLC by AJCC (The American Joint Committee on Cancer) version 8. The tumor must have been deemed resectable by a thoracic surgeon, the participant must be determined to be medically operable based on the determination of a thoracic surgeon, and the participant must not have received prior systemic therapy, including prior radiation therapy, for NSCLC.

Key Exclusion Criteria (Phase 1 and Phase 2):

Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2: an additional known oncogenic driver
Cohorts 3 and 4: Enrollment closed
Cohorts 1, 2 and 5: prior treatment with a selective RET inhibitor Notes: Participants otherwise eligible for Cohorts 1, 2, and 5 who discontinued another selective RET inhibitor may be eligible for Phase 2 Cohort 6 with prior Sponsor approval
Investigational agent or anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, anticancer Chinese medicine or other anticancer herbal remedy) within 5 half-lives or 2 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to planned start of LOXO-292 (selpercatinib). In addition, no concurrent investigational anti-cancer therapy is permitted Note: Potential exception for this exclusion criterion will require a valid scientific justification and approval from the Sponsor
Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to planned start of LOXO-292 (selpercatinib)</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This is an open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of selpercatinib (also known as LOXO-292) administered orally to participants with advanced solid tumors, including rearranged during transfection (RET)-fusion-positive solid tumors, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other tumors with RET activation.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial studies how well chemotherapy and radiation therapy work with or without atezolizumab in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitomycin-C, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to radiation therapy and chemotherapy without atezolizumab.

Several genes have been found to be altered or mutated in brain metastases such as NTRK, ROS1, CDK or PI3K. Medications that target these genes such as abemaciclib, paxalisib, and entrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Genetic testing may help doctors tailor treatment for each mutation.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
You must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
Histologically/pathologically confirmed stage IIA adenocarcinoma of the colon (T3, N0, M0) with at least 12 lymph nodes examined at the time of surgical resection.
Appropriate for active surveillance (i.e., no adjuvant chemotherapy) at the discretion of and as documented by the evaluating oncologist based on current practice patterns.
The distal extent of the tumor must be &gt;= 12 cm from the anal verge on pre-surgical endoscopy (i.e., excluding rectal adenocarcinomas warranting treatment with chemoradiation). If the patient did not undergo a pre-surgical endoscopy, then the distal extent of the tumor must be &gt;= 12 cm from the anal verge as determined by surgical examination or pre-operative imaging.
You must have had an en bloc complete gross resection of tumor (curative resection) as definitive surgical cancer treatment within 14 to 60 days of study randomization. Patients who have had a two-stage surgical procedure to first provide a decompressive colostomy and then, in a later procedure, to have the definitive surgical resection, are eligible.
Availability and provision of adequate surgical tumor tissue for molecular diagnostics and confirmatory profiling.

Exclusion Criteria:
Colon cancer histology other than adenocarcinoma (i.e., neuroendocrine carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.).
Pathologic, clinical, or radiologic evidence of overt metastatic disease. This includes isolated, distant, or non-contiguous intra-abdominal metastases, even if resected (including the presence of satellite nodules constituting N1c disease in the absence of lymph node involvement).
Tumor-related bowel perforation.
History of prior invasive colon malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval.
History of organ transplantation.
Any prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy; or radiation therapy administered as treatment for colorectal cancer (e.g., primary rectal adenocarcinomas for which treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation is warranted are not permitted).
Other invasive malignancy within 5 years before randomization. Exceptions are colonic polyps, non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ including those of the cervix and breast (DCIS).
Synchronous primary rectal and/or colon cancers.
Antineoplastic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy) within 5 years before randomization. (For the purposes of this study, hormonal therapy is not considered chemotherapy.).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial studies how well circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) testing in the blood works in predicting treatment for patients with stage IIA colon cancer after surgery. ctDNA are circulating tumor cells that are shed by tumors into the blood. Finding ctDNA in the blood means that there is very likely some small amounts of cancer that remain after surgery. However, this cancer, if detected, cannot be found on other tests usually used to find cancer, as it is too small. Testing for ctDNA levels may help identify patients with colon cancer after surgery who do benefit, and those who do not benefit, from receiving chemotherapy.

- Patient must not have had prior potentially curative surgery (i.e. abdominal-perineal resection) for carcinoma of the anus.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies how well lower-dose chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) therapy works in comparison to standard-dose chemoradiation in treating patients with early-stage anal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This study may help doctors find out if lower-dose chemoradiation is as effective and has fewer side effects than standard-dose chemoradiation, which is the usual approach for treatment of this cancer type.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants with advanced liver cancers. The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, modify the participant population, or introduce additional cohorts of participants with other types of advanced primary liver cancer.

Cohort 1 will enroll participants with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease. Eligible participants will initially be randomly assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). Participants who experience loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to receive treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2). When a Stage 2 treatment combination is available, this will be introduced by amending the protocol.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this research study is to see if sequential intravenous chemotherapy followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy with paclitaxel combination is safe and will improve cancer control in patients who have gastric cancer that is spread in the abdominal lining ( peritoneum) called peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Currently, patients with gastric cancer who have cancer spread to the abdominal lining are only treated with intravenous chemotherapy, which is chemotherapy administered through the vein into the body. We are proposing to add intraperitoneal chemotherapy (chemotherapy infused into the abdominal cavity through a small access device implanted into the abdominal fat tissue) to the usually used intravenous chemotherapy, to study if this combination improves survival in patients.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or without personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine (neoantigen vaccine) works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

Radium-223 dichloride is a radioactive drug that behaves in a similar way to calcium and collects in cancer that has spread to the bones (bone metastases). The radioactive particles in radium-223 dichloride act on bone metastases, killing the tumor cells and reducing the pain that they can cause. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

    <DESCRIPTION>More than 130 primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Most affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patients must have newly diagnosed untreated biopsy-proven, metastatic pancreatic cancer. Previous surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy is allowed, provided radiation therapy is completed at least 2 weeks prior to registration and adjuvant therapy was administered more than 6 months prior to registration. Patients with the following histology are excluded: Acinar cell; Adenosquamous carcinoma.
- Patients must be at least 70 years of age or older.
- Patient must agree not to take any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine). Those who are randomized to liposomal irinotecan treatment arm should avoid drugs that are UGT1A1 (enzyme found in the liver) inhibitors.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to find out if two treatment combinations: Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel or 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Liposomal Irinotecan, is more effective at lengthening the lives of "vulnerable" patients over the age of 70 with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Currently, there is no known best practice for this type of patient. </DESCRIPTION>

- Diagnosed with &amp;#955; LC MGUS or &amp;#955; LC SMM
- dFLC greater than 23 mg/L and &amp;#954;::&amp;#955; free LC ratio below normal

If the patient has an eGFR less than 50 mL/min/1.73m2, the &amp;#954;::&amp;#955; free LC ratio is inconsequential. The patient only needs to meet the age, dFLC, and &amp;#955; LC MGUS or &amp;#955; LC SMM diagnosis criteria in this case 

Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients with &amp;#954; LC MGUS or &amp;#954; LC SMM
- Amyloid in the bone marrow or in other biopsies will not be included</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to see whether certain genes may be linked with the development of AL amyloidosis in subjects 60 years of age or older with the blood disorders SMM and MGUS. A limited repertoire of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region genes have been associated with AL amyloidosis. The clonal plasma cells of subjects with SMM and MGUS may express one of these Ig variable region genes indicating a risk of progression to AL amyloidosis and potentially enabling early diagnosis. We hope this study will help us begin to understand whether Ig variable region gene identification can be a useful tool for assessing a subject's risk of progression to AL amyloidosis.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>AlloHeme is a chimerism test service that utilizes NGS technology to analyze SNP loci to quantify donor and recipient cells by measuring genomic DNA. Before transplant, patient and donor peripheral blood sample will be collected to identify informative marker for routine chimerism testing and baseline establishment for AlloHeme. Post-transplant blood or bone marrow samples are obtained and compared to the baseline sample profiles to calculate % chimerism of recipient cells in the blood and/or bone marrow samples. Cell selection from blood and bone marrow samples is applied to evaluate chimerism in specific cell subtypes that are relevant to AML and MDS diseases (CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD33+ Myeloid cells and CD15+ Granulocyte cell subtypes from blood and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow).</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>AB-101 is an off-the shelf, allogeneic cell product made of "natural killer" cells, also called NK cells. White blood cells are part of the immune system and NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to kill cancer cells.

This clinical trial is conducted in two phases. The primary objective of Phase 1 is to test the safety of AB-101 given alone or in combination with rituximab. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine if AB-101 in combination with rituximab has activity in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin.

Patients will receive eight weekly doses of AB-101 followed by scheduled assessments of overall health and tumor response.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab versus delayed treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
-HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required
* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
-Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
-Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
-Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
-The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis
* Note: The presence of micrometastases in lymph nodes after preoperative therapy counts as residual disease, whereas the presence of isolated tumor cells does not

Exclusion Criteria:
-No adjuvant treatment with any anti-cancer investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration
-Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration is required
-Patients with known active and/or untreated hepatitis B or hepatitis C or chronic liver disease are ineligible. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B or C that has been treated and cleared and normal liver function are eligible to participate in the study if the other eligibility parameters are met</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and tucatinib work in preventing breast cancer from coming back (relapsing) in patients with high risk, HER2 positive breast cancer. T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study will test an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) alone and with different combinations of anticancer therapies. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) that is used to treat patients with cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This type of cancer includes cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra. Some parts of the study will look at locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC), which means the cancer has spread to nearby tissues or to other areas of the body. Other parts of the study will look at muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which is cancer at an earlier stage that has spread into the muscle wall of the bladder. This study will look at the side effects of enfortumab vedotin alone and with other anticancer therapies. A side effect is a response to a drug that is not part of the treatment effect. This study will also test if the cancer shrinks with the different treatment combinations.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab when given together with or without sargramostim and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating patients with melanoma.</DESCRIPTION>

Pathologically confirmed, definitively diagnosed, metastatic NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR mutation.
Previously received at least 1 prior EGFR-targeted TKI. For patients enrolled to expansion Group 2, prior treatment must include an approved EGFR-targeted TKI with activity against the T790M mutation, such as osimertinib.
EGFR mutation profile determined locally via a Sponsor-approved testing methodology, using either tumor tissue (ideally from a progressing lesion) and/or ctDNA in plasma. It is preferable that samples used for analysis be obtained during or after disease progression on the last EGFR-targeted TKI received.

Dose escalation: At each dose level, slots may be reserved for patients with the mutations of interest.
Expansion Groups: Patients must have NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M and C797S mutation (Group 1); EGFR T790M but not C797S (Group 2); or EGFR C797S but not T790M (Group 3).
Pretreatment tumor sample (either an archival sample or a sample obtained by pretreatment biopsy) submitted for central analysis. It is preferable that pretreatment tumor samples be obtained from a progression lesion, during or after disease progression on the last EGFR-targeted TKI received.

Patients without archival tissue available, where biopsy is not considered safe and/or medically feasible, may be discussed with the study medical monitor and may be approved for enrollment on a case-by-case basis.

Phase 2 Expansion Groups: Patient has at least 1 measurable target lesion evaluable by RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator.

    <DESCRIPTION>This trial studies how well atezolizumab added to the usual radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with early non-small cell lung cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies the effect of sacituzumab govitecan in treating patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases). Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and/or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.</DESCRIPTION>

We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you
- Histologically confirmed NSCLC that is at advanced stage for which there are no approved therapies available expected to confer clinical benefit as defined in the protocol
- Willing to provide tumor tissue from newly obtained biopsy from tumor site. Newly obtained biopsies at tissue screening are required. An archival sample can be accepted only after discussion with the medical monitor and if the sample is not more than 6 months old and obtained after completion of the last therapy. The enrollment of patients will be based on an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assay using freshly obtained tumor biopsies or an archival biopsy as described above. Only patients with MET overexpressing tumors by central IHC analysis will be enrolled. For expansion cohorts only: tumor site for biopsy must not have been irradiated previously and must not be the only measurable lesion.
- Tumor must overexpress MET protein as defined in the protocol by central IHC analysis
- For expansion only: At least one lesion that is measurable by RECIST 1.1. Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions after radiation.
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
- Adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in the protocol

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you
- Has received treatment with an approved systemic therapy or has participated in any study of an investigational agent or investigational device within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives of the prior treatment, whichever is shorter with a minimum of 7 days from the first dose of study therapy
- Has not yet recovered (ie, grade &amp;#8804;1 or baseline) from any acute toxicities resulting from prior therapy except as described in the protocol
- Has received radiation therapy or major surgery within 14 days of first administration of study drug or has not recovered from adverse events as defined in the protocol
- Another malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment except as noted in the protocol
- Untreated or active primary brain tumor, central nervous system (CNS) metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression as defined in the protocol
- Encephalitis, meningitis, organic brain disease (eg Parkinson's disease) or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to first dose of study therapy
- Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection; or diagnosis of immunodeficiency as defined in the protocol</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Brief Summary:
The primary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:

To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) REGN5093-M114 in order to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN5093-M114 in patients with mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:

To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 in MET-overexpressed NSCLC as measured by the objective response rate (ORR)

The secondary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:

To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 as measured by the ORR

The secondary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:

To assess the safety, tolerability profile, and PK of REGN5093-M114 ADC and total antibody in each expansion cohort

The secondary objectives of both phases of the study are:

To evaluate other measures of preliminary anti-tumor activity
To assess immunogenicity to REGN5093-M114</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibilities:
- Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC or other solid tumors.
- Evidence of ROS1 fusion in tumor tissue determined by molecular assays as performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or locally equivalent laboratories.
- Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which is either asymptomatic or previously treated and controlled, are allowed; the use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAEDs). If corticosteroid treatment is required, it should be on stable or decreasing dose of &amp;#8804;10 mg prednisone or equivalent. If patients have neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastasis, patients need to complete whole brain radiation or gamma knife irradiation treatment at least 14 days before enrollment and be clinically stable.
- The patient is either ROS1 TKI treatment naïve, or treated with prior ROS1 TKI(s).
Exclusion:
- Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks (or 5 half-lives of the compound, whichever is longer) prior to study enrollment. In addition, no concurrent anticancer therapy is permitted.
- Previously treated with immuno-oncology (IO) including immune checkpoint inhibitors within 12 weeks before enrollment.
- Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
- Radiation therapy with a limited field for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment.
- Toxicities due to prior therapy are unresolved to &amp;#8804; CTCAE 5.0 Grade 1 except for AEs not constituting a safety risk to the patient based on the judgment of investigators.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This is a global Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of taletrectinib in patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.

119 patients will be enrolled and divided into 4 cohorts, depending on past history of ROS1 TKI treatment.

Taletrectinib will be administered 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. Patients will continue with the study treatment until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.

The tumor response evaluation will be conducted on a regular basis until progression of disease. Long-term survival follow up will be conducted as well.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to test ERAS-007 in combination with other drugs for the treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.  The study is divided into sub-studies based on mutation status and number of prior therapies.  You are being asked to take part in this portion of the research study because you have been diagnosed with a type of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer with a specific change (or mutation) in the BRAF gene (BRAF V600E).  This change leads to the uncontrolled growth and spread of the affected colon cells into colon cancer.  ERAS-007 in combination with other therapies is designed to target these mutations.  ERAS-007 is an investigational drug that has shown anti-cancer activity in animals and humans by blocking a cell pathway that contributes to cancer formation and progression.  Investigational means that the drug has not been approved by health authorities, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), for the treatment of people with your medical condition.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

You are eligible to participate if:

- You have inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic disease.
- You have confirmed anal cancer (includes basaloid and cloacogenic lesions).
- You are a woman and currently not pregnant or breast-feeding.
- You have not had prior immunotherapy. 
</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to answer the following question: Will adding an immune checkpoint inhibitor to the usual combination of chemotherapy drugs help prevent your cancer from getting worse?
We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for your anal canal cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for naïve metastatic anal cancer. These treatments may reduce symptoms and may stop the tumor from growing for a few months or longer.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares less intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer and low gene risk score. This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The objective of this pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SIRT using SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres as first-line treatment for local control of HCC in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, B1, B2, and C.

SIR-Spheres consist of biocompatible resin microspheres containing yttrium-90 (Y-90), with a size between 20 and 60 microns in diameter. Y-90 is a high-energy pure beta-emitting isotope with no primary gamma emission.

SIR-Spheres are indicated for the local tumor control of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, B1 and B2, maximal single lesion size of 8 cm, no macrovascular invasion, well-compensated liver function and good performance status. It is also indicated for the treatment of unresectable metastatic liver tumors from primary colorectal cancer with adjuvant intra-hepatic artery chemotherapy (IHAC) of Floxuridine (FUDR).</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies the effect of capecitabine and temozolomide after surgery in treating patients with high-risk well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as capecitabine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving capecitabine and temozolomide after surgery could prevent or delay the return of cancer in patients with high-risk well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patient must have histological or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarinoma.
- Patient must have one of the following mutations: germline mutation in BRCA 1 or 2 from a CLIA certified lab defined as positive and/or deleterious (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant).
- Patient must have metastatic disease and received first line platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e. FOLFIRINOX, FOLOFX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin or gemcitabine + cisplatin). </DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment (olaparib) alone to using pembrolizumab plus the usual treatment.  The addition of pembrolizumab to the usual treatment could help to shrink your cancer   but, it could also cause side effects. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is  better, the same, or worse than the usual approach.  To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the study drug pembrolizumab increases the time it takes for the cancer to grow  by 5 months or more compared to the usual approach.  

Olaparib alone has been approved as maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated pancreatic cancer. </DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>You need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study:

- You will be asked about your health history including any surgeries you've had and the treatments you've received for your cancer. 
- Complete physical exam 
- Performance status assessment, to see how able you are to perform your daily activities. 
- Measurement of your height and weight
- Vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, heart rate, breathing (respiratory) rate, and body temperature.
- Routine blood tests [about 13 mL or 2 ½ teaspoons of blood (in total)] to test your:

- blood counts (white blood cells, red blood cells, etc.),
- liver, kidney, and thyroid function,
- cholesterol while fasting (no food within 6 hours),
- blood clotting ability.

- Blood test [about 1.5 mL or ¼ teaspoon of blood] for specific viruses, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and HIV. If you have positive test results for HIV or Hepatitis B or C, we will notify you. We are required to notify state health authorities of positive results.
- Routine urine testing
- Blood or urine test for pregnancy, if you are a woman who is capable of childbearing (unless you have had a hysterectomy or your tubes tied, or you are in menopause and your last menstrual period was at least 1 year ago). 
 
- Evaluation of the location and size of your cancer will be performed. 

- Your doctor may use different types of imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), clinical exam or some combination of these tests.

- Electrocardiogram (ECG): a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart by using electrodes placed on your body. This assessment is not invasive which means that it does not involve the introduction of instruments or other objects into the body or body cavities.
-You will be asked about all medications (including over-the-counter and herbal remedies) you are taking and have taken in the past month.
- You will be asked to describe any symptoms you are currently experiencing.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>

- Expected survival &gt;=12 weeks
- Histologically-confirmed, locally-advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer (LA/mUC), including UC originating from the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, or urethra

Exclusion Criteria:
- Known hypersensitivity to disitamab vedotin, pembrolizumab (in Cohort C), or any of their components
- Prior antitumor treatment (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy etc.) within 2 weeks of start of study
- Major surgery that has not fully recovered within 4 weeks prior to dose administration</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to see if a drug called disitamab vedotin, alone or with pembrolizumab, works to treat HER2 expressing urothelial cancer. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants.

Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).

It will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are "immunotherapies" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a "targeted therapy" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
You must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. The date of diagnosis will be determined according to the pathologic date of diagnosis
You must have measurable disease according to RECIST1.1 criteria. Computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) used to assess measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. CT scans or MRIs used to assess non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have documented unresectable and/or metastatic disease on CT or MRI imaging. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have BRAF^V600E mutated colorectal cancer as tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory
You must have proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS) status as tested in a CLIA-certified laboratory and documented by the treating clinician. Proficient mismatch repair status can be determined by intact expression by immunohistochemistry of all 4 mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2). Microsatellite instability can be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Exclusion Criteria:
You must not have a known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction
You must not have had prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including, but not limited to, encorafenib, dabrafenib, or vemurafenib), MEK inhibitor (including, but not limited to, trametinib, selumetinib, or binimetinib), or ERK inhibitor (of note, regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the context of eligibility criteria)
You must not have had prior treatment with anti-EGFR therapies
You must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether adding nivolumab to the usual treatment (encorafenib and cetuximab) works better than the usual treatment alone to shrink tumors in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose tumor has a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

    <DESCRIPTION>Why are we doing this study and why have you been asked to take part?

We are asking you to join this study because you are suffering from cancer of the blood and bone 
marrow. In this study, we are looking at a new investigational drug called LYT-200 that is 
intended to inhibit (hinder) galectin-9. Galectin-9 is a protein which suppresses immune function
and disables immune-mediated attack on the cancer cells through multiple pathways. At present, 
there are no approved therapies targeting galectin-9 for any disease. Early studies conducted in 
animals suggest LYT-200 might be a good treatment for patients with blood and bone marrow 
cancer.
This study is among the first research studies of LYT-200 in people and its main purpose is to 
test its safety and tolerability in patients suffering from two types of blood and bone marrow 
cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we 
shall also examine how the drug is changed by and removed from the body and will look for 
signs that the drug may be effective against AML or MDS. LYT-200 will be tested at several 
different doses.
