Biopsy proven (from primary lesion and/or lymph nodes) diagnosis of cancer of the nasopharynx
Sites are required to complete Step 1 registration before submitting specimens for EBV DNA analysis.

Patients must have detectable pretreatment plasma EBV DNA, determined by the central lab prior to Step 2 registration (see Section 10.2 for details of specimen submission).
For patients who have detectable plasma EBV DNA tested at one of the credentialed central labs (listed on the EBV DNA Testing Specimen Transmittal form) within 28 days prior to Step 1 registration: that test result can be used for eligibility without the need for re-testing. To use this test result for eligibility, the central lab must enter the test result through the pathology portal, and the site must follow the instructions in Section 5.4.
Stage II-IVB disease (AJCC, 7th ed.) with no evidence of distant metastasis, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

History/physical examination by a Medical Oncologist or Clinical Oncologist or Radiation Oncologist or ENT, which must include an endoscopic evaluation, a complete list of current medications, and assessment of weight and weight loss in the past 6 months within 21 days prior to registration;
Evaluation of tumor extent required within 28 days prior to registration:
MRI of the nasopharynx and neck; or CT of the nasopharynx and neck with &#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and bone windows (to evaluate base of skull involvement).
Note: If a treatment planning CT scan is used, it must be with &#8804; 3 mm contiguous slices with contrast and be read by a radiologist.

Exclusion Criteria:

Prior invasive malignancy (except node negative, non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 1095 days (3 years) (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible)
Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable; however, at least 6-weeks recovery is necessary if the last regimen included nitrosourea or mitomycin
Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields
Patients with hearing loss assessed to be primarily sensorineural in nature, requiring a hearing aid, or intervention (i.e. interfering in a clinically significant way with activities of daily living); a conductive hearing loss that is tumor-related is allowed
&#8805; Grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy (CTCAE, v. 4.0)
Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the completion of therapy and follow up or with full understanding of the risks and potential complications of the therapy
Unstable angina and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure within the past 6 months
Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months
Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; note that patients switched from IV antibiotics and currently on oral antibiotics whose infection is assessed to be adequately treated or controlled are eligible
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days prior to registration
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception","There are two study questions we are asking in this randomized phase II/III trial based on a blood biomarker, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for locoregionally advanced non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. All patients will first undergo standard concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When this standard treatment is completed, if there is no detectable EBV DNA in their plasma, then patients are randomized to either standard adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy or observation. If there is still detectable levels of plasma EBV DNA, patients will be randomized to standard cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy versus gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and fluorouracil is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel after radiation therapy in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.",II/III,Treatment,Adults,Local,,,2022-01-06T22:40:08,CFCCC,"Lip, Oral Cavity and Pharynx","Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, NRG Oncology",,

You can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.","UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be treated
by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently available.

Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and
new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. In order to conduct this research, we need
to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. In order
to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies
that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. In certain circumstances (blood
draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the
sample that would be collected for your routine care. Except for giving samples of blood, you will not be
asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. 

You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a
hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.

This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing.
It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their collaborators (including for-profit entities) may request permission to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.

These studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may
include the study of genetics, including the subject&#8217;s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole
genome sequencing.

&#8226;	Phase 1: Phase 1 of this research study is currently ongoing. It was the first time that the study drug, reprotrectinib, was given to humans.
o	The purpose of Phase 1 was to determine the dose of repotrectinib to use in Phase 2 of the study.  Phase 1 look at the side effects and response of tumors to different doses of repotrectinib. Phase 1 also looked at how different foods affect how repotrectinib gets into the body. Phase 1 includes the following sub-studies:
&#61607;	Phase 1a, where the study drug is given under fasting conditions. You will need to fast 1 hour before and 2 hours after study drug administration. As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects
&#61607;	Phase 1b is a Food Effect Sub-Study (a study within a study). You may be asked to participate in the Food Effect Sub-Study. The purpose of the Food Effect Sub-Study is to determine the effect of high-fat, high-calorie food on a single dose of repotrectinib (how much and how fast repotrectinib gets into the body after a meal). As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects.
&#61607;	Phase 1 also includes a study of repotrectinib when administered continuously with food, where you will take every dose of the study drug with a standard meal, called Phase 1c. 
&#8226;	Phase 2: You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study (not Phase 1). The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine, more specifically, whether repotrectinib works, especially in groups of subjects who have the various tumor gene rearrangements mentioned above. Phase 2 will also continue to look at the side effects as well as how repotrectinib is absorbed into the body.
The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of repotrectinib at the dose listed below:
&#8226;	160 mg once a day for 14 days that may increase to 160 mg twice a day based on the drug&#8217;s tolerability

T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with early non-small cell lung cancer.",III,Treatment,Adults,National,,,2022-01-06T22:37:35,CFCCC,Lung,SWOG,,

Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction

Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

intended to inhibit (hinder) galectin-9. Galectin-9 is a protein which suppresses immune function
and disables immune-mediated attack on the cancer cells through multiple pathways. At present, 
there are no approved therapies targeting galectin-9 for any disease. Early studies conducted in 
animals suggest LYT-200 might be a good treatment for patients with blood and bone marrow 
cancer.
This study is among the first research studies of LYT-200 in people and its main purpose is to 
test its safety and tolerability in patients suffering from two types of blood and bone marrow 
cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we

However, despite pharmacokinetic studies showing bioequivalence, questions remain regarding the clinical impact of use of generic immunosuppression.

The most important immunosuppressive agent in the modern transplant era is arguably tacrolimus, a calcineurin-inhibitor with a narrow therapeutic index. This study seeks to answer the question regarding the clinical impact of generic tacrolimus use as measured primarily by acute rejection, loss of graft function, and patient death through a randomized trial of 2 phases: Brand tacrolimus only, and Generic A tacrolimus only. Given that kidney transplantations are the most commonly performed transplants with well-defined measures of rejection and graft failure, this organs will be studied in a six-center study designed to accrue the target number of transplant recipients within the one-year study period.

In a national database review, rib fractures were associated with a 10% mortality rate, however, with every additional rib fracture there was an increase in mortality.2 Elderly patients are especially vulnerable with a mortality nearly double that of their younger counterparts.3,4 Optimizing analgesia has become cornerstone in the management of rib fractures, improved pain control leads to better pulmonary mechanics and fewer complications. Most often this is done with either an epidural catheter or a multimodal pain regimen consisting of: acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), trans-dermal lidocaine, muscle relaxants, and opioids.5 Unfortunately, epidural catheters are an invasive procedure and have associated complications, and opioids can cause respiratory suppression and risk of addiction. 
Dexmedetomidine (precedex) is a promising alternative to treat acute pain associated with rib fractures. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2 agonist that has sedative, analgesic, and sympathetic properties with less respiratory depression compared to opioids.6 Dexmedetomidine is routinely used in the ICU for sedation and has shown promise as an analgesic. Multiple systemic reviews and meta-analysis have suggested the benefits of dexmedetomidine for post-operative pain. Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine can decrease pain scores, decrease morphine equivalents, and decrease adverse events from opioids.7-9 
Given the lack of evidence and prospective data on the use of IV dexmedetomidine in the treatment of acute pain in rib fractures, we plan to perform a prospective randomized control trial to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct analgesic. We hypothesize that a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine will decrease pain scores and opioid use in patients presenting with multiple rib fractures.",2023-02-07T13:30:20,SOM/Surgery,"Trauma, Muscles and Bones - Musculoskeletal, Rib Fractures",UCI,,

Huntington's Disease","Study Population:
Patients with HD and their family members are recruited from specialty clinics (Human Genetics, Neurology, Psychiatry) that advise and treat people affected by HD. In addition, in some areas community clinics and neurologists who see HD patients recruit participants for this study. Participants also receive information about the study through websites, clinical practices, support groups, advocacy newsletters, etc. and place a direct request to be considered for participation in the study. Community controls are identified by study site staff (using advertisements, flyers and newsletters) with the support of the Enroll-HD operational staff.

Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Carriers: This group comprises the primary study population and consists of individuals who carry the HD gene expansion mutation.
2.  Controls: This group comprises the comparator study population and consists of individuals who do not carry the HD expansion mutation.
3.  These two major categories can be further subdivided into six different subgroups of eligible individuals:
4.  Manifest/Motor-manifest HD: Carriers with clinical features that are regarded in the opinion of the investigator as diagnostic of HD.
5.  Pre-Manifest/-Motor-manifest HD: Carriers without clinical features regarded as diagnostic of HD.
6.  Genotype Unknown: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has not undergone predictive testing for HD and therefore has an undetermined carrier status.
7.  Genotype Negative: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has undergone predictive testing for HD and is known not to carry the HD expansion mutation.
8.  Family Control: Family members or individuals not related by blood to carriers (e.g., spouses, partners, caregivers).
9.  Community Controls: Individuals unrelated to HD carriers who did not grow up in a family affected by HD. Data collected from community controls will be used for generation of normative data for sub-studies.
10.  Participant status will be captured in the study database using 2 variables: 1) Investigator Determined Status: this will be based on clinical signs and symptoms and genotyping performed as part of medical care, and will be updated at every visit; and 2) Research Genotyping Status: this will be based on genotyping conducted as part of Enroll-HD study procedures. Based on research genotyping, participants will be reclassified under this variable from Genotype Unknown to 'Carriers' or 'Controls'. Investigators and participants will be blinded to this reclassification.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria,
2.  Individuals with choreic movement disorders in the context of a negative test for the HD gene mutation.
3.  For Community Controls: those individuals with a major central nervous system disorder will be excluded (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.).

This protocol is also designed to collect and evaluate the safety and clinical performance of NexoBrid in patients suffering from DPT and FT thermal burns.

Following the enrollment of a patient to the protocol, physicians will identify one or more target wounds (TWs) per patient according to the TW definition. All patient's DPT and FT burns that comply with the specified entrance criteria will be treated with NexoBrid and, therefore, must be designated as TWs. This will further allow an evaluation of the patient's systemic safety by allowing treatment of the patient's entire deep burns.

Prior to initiation of eschar removal treatment, patients will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions according to product instruction for use in order to ensure clean and moist eschar covered wound bed for NexoBrid application. Vital signs (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and temperature) measurements and pain assessment will be performed within 24 hrs before start of treatment as well as haematology, biochemistry blood tests & PTT/INR. Pressure measurements for circumferential extremity wounds will be performed 1 hour before start of treatment and will be closely monitored during treatment. Following wound cleansing and soaking treatments, patients will undergo the eschar removal process. TWs of up to 15% total body surface area (TBSA) will be treated with a single application of NexoBrid for 4 hours. Patients with TWs >15% TBSA and up to 30% TBSA will be treated with 2 consecutive applications of 4 hours each. NexoBrid should not be applied to more than 15% TBSA in one session. PK samples will be taken from sub-set of patients with TWs area >15% TBSA. Pressure measurements for circumferential extremity wounds will be performed after the removal of NexoBrid.

Post eschar removal completion, patients will undergo daily vital signs (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and temperature measurements) and pain assessments for 1 week, starting on the morning following start of eschar removal. Blood tests (haematology and biochemistry) will be performed 24 ± 6 hrs post eschar removal as well as PTT/INR. Weekly assessments of wound healing progress including the dressings used until complete wound closure will be performed.

Cosmesis (scar quality) evaluation (using MVSS) will be performed at 3 and 12 months post wound closure confirmation visit.",,INT - Biological/vaccine,Adults,,,"Enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid allows initiating and completing the phase of removal of the offending eschar earlier upon admission, enabling earlier visualization of the wound bed for assessment of burn wound depth as well as preservation of viable dermal tissues, as further elaborated and supported by previous clinical studies. The depth determination is important for the planning and execution of the post eschar removal stage of wound closure phase (grafting or spontaneous epithelialization).

Additional clinically meaningful attributes of NexoBrid enzymatic eschar removal is the ability to lower surgical burden as it allows to remove eschar in wounds that otherwise would have to undergo surgical excision as no other non-surgical treatment is available for early and effective eschar removal.

MediWound has completed the recruitment of patients to study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT Study). The timeline for patients' follow-up and potential for approval in 2021/2022, creates a significant gap in the ability of clinical practitioner's to maintain their knowledge and skills in using NexoBrid as they no longer treat eligible patients. The expanded access protocol will allow to expand treatment to additional patients in up to 30 US burn centers (DETECT sites and additional sites), until the completion of the BLA assessment and possible marketing authorization of NexoBrid in the US. The proposed protocol will allow product availability to eligible population and keep the clinical use of the product knowledge active in the burn care community introducing it to their routine burn care.

The purpose of this treatment protocol is to provide NexoBrid to patients with DPT and FT thermal burns on up to 30% TBSA.

This protocol is also designed to collect and evaluate the safety and clinical performance of NexoBrid in this patient population.",2023-02-03T15:01:11,CCR,"Skin - Dermatologic, Burn Injuries","MediWound, Ltd",,

Much attention is paid to the variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear, is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity and represent a large unmet clinical need.

Recent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of the LGMD mutations.

Recruitment of 860 participants over 3½ years is planned. Countries participating in the trial include the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Participants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 µg/kg dose (maximum 10 mg dose) or placebo. Participants in both arms will receive best standard therapy as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg.

According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration) and sent for fluid analysis (CEA and amylase) and cytology. However, despite use of a cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level cutoff of 192 ng/mL and cytology, accuracy of diagnosis for PCLs is poor. As the spectrum ranges from benign to high risk for neoplasm, precise diagnosis is critical. More recently, the adjunctive use of the Moray® through the needle microforceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a microforceps through a 19-guage needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. Pancreatic cysts continue to pose a management dilemma for practicing clinicians, especially with the increased use of radiologic imaging modalities identifying incidental pancreatic cystic lesions with higher frequency. This leads to patient anxiety and increased costs due to radiologic surveillance and even surgery. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.",,INT - Device,Adults,,,,2023-05-15T09:43:38,CCR,"Pancreatic Cyst, Digestive - Gastrointestinal","University of Colorado Denver, US Endoscopy",,

To ensure diversity, the study will enroll at least 2,000 Blacks/African Americans, at least 2,000 Latinos/Hispanics, and up to 3,000 additional participants from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on disease stage prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having MCI or dementia as their disease stage. Based on their clinical presentation prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having ""typical"" (i.e. progressive amnestic) or ""atypical"" clinical presentations of AD as the potential cause of dementia or MCI.

Dementia specialists will team with PET facilities that have trained radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and access to perform amyloid PET. All participating physicians and study staff will complete comprehensive training to ensure adherence of data requirements and study timelines. Amyloid PET will be performed and interpreted at each facility with results provided to the ordering dementia specialist for support in further decision making. The dementia specialists will record their diagnosis and intended management plan based on the current clinical and diagnostic information, and assuming no future access to amyloid PET at the ""Pre-PET visit."" This represents a ""thought experiment"" documenting the management plan that would be recommended by the specialist if the participant were not enrolling in New IDEAS and thus had no access to amyloid PET. PET results will be disclosed to patients and any consequent changes in management (if any) will be recommended at the ""PET disclosure visit."" Patients will return 90 ± 30 days following PET for an in person ""Post-PET visit."" At this final visit, the dementia specialists will record the diagnosis and implemented management plan, incorporating amyloid PET into clinical decision making. Medicare claims data will be collected directly from CMS for 12 months prior to the PET imaging and 12 months after the PET imaging, for each participant.

Aim 1 utilizes Medicare claims data to compare 12-month claims-derived outcomes in amyloid PET-positive versus amyloid PET-negative individuals with MCI and dementia across the entire cohort. Aims 2 and 3 investigate these associations in sub-groups of study participants based on self-identified race and ethnicity (Aim 2) and clinical presentation (Aim 3). Aims 2 and 3 additionally evaluate changes in management between the pre- and post-PET visits in the relevant sub-groups, to test whether benefits in health outcomes are mediated by changes in clinical management. The investigator's over-arching hypothesis, supported by preliminary data from the first IDEAS study, is that amyloid PET results will be associated with changes in clinical management, which in turn will translate into improved health outcomes in patients with amyloid PET-positive scans in comparison with patients with amyloid PET-negative scans. We further hypothesize that these effects will be seen across patients of different ethnoracial backgrounds, clinical presentations and disease stages (MCI and dementia).

Approximately 216 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into one of 4 groups using a computer generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization will be first stratified by gender (male or female) and then by risk for organ failure in the gender subgroups (higher or lower). Higher risk for organ failure is defined by the presence of both an elevated hematocrit (HCT &#8805;44% for men or &#8805;40% for women) and hypoxemia (imputed PaO2/FiO2 &#8804;360). Lower risk for organ failure is defined by the absence of either or both an elevated hematocrit and hypoxemia. The PaO2/FiO2 will be determined using an arterial blood gas or imputed using pulse oximetry.

All patients will have received a Screening CECT of the abdomen/pancreas before being randomized into the study. CECTs performed as standard of care may be used as the Screening CECT but must have been performed in the 24 hours before Consent or after Consent and before Randomization.

The Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur within 8 hours of the patient or LAR providing informed consent. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 1.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 3 will receive 0.5 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 4 will receive emulsion without any active pharmaceutical ingredient. Patients in Group 4 will receive one of three randomly assigned dose volumes, 1.25 mL/kg, 0.625 mL/kg, or 0.3125 mL/kg, which will be administered intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of hospitalization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, the upper limit of the volume of Auxora and volume of Placebo that will be administered will be 156.25 mL. The sponsor, investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. In the event of a medical emergency, investigators will be able to receive the treatment assignment if required to provide optimal care of the patient.

For all 4 groups, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform assessments at screening, at the baseline assessment, immediately prior to the SFISD, and then every 24 hours until 240 hours after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. If patients remain hospitalized at Day 12, assessments will then be performed every 48 hours starting on Day 12 until Day 28, or until discharge if earlier. Patients discharged from the hospital before Day 25 will return at Day 30 (+5 days) to perform the Day 30 assessments. If patients are discharged on Days 25-29, the Day 30 assessments may be performed prior to discharge.

Patients will receive another CECT of the abdomen/pancreas at the Day 30 (±5 days) visit. All CECTs performed as standard of care after randomization and before the Day 30 CECT will also be captured. A blinded central reader will read the Screening, Day 30, and any standard of care CECTs obtained between randomization and the Day 30 visit.

Ability and willingness to attend study visits and complete the study","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, ~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as ""second-line"" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome.",II,INT - Drug,Adults,,,"Determine the difference in the modified Rankin score at 16 weeks in participants with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis treated with ""first-line"" immunomodulatory therapies provided as standard-of-care, and either inebilizumab (investigational agent) or placebo.",2023-02-03T16:03:09,CCR,"Brain - Neurologic/ Psychologic, Encephalitis","NIH, Massachusetts General Hospital",,

4.  Has a history of primary immunodeficiency or secondary immunodeficiency not related to the treatment of the participants IIM
5.  Has experienced myocardial infarction (MI), unstable ischemic heart disease, or stroke within 12 weeks of screening","IIM is considered as a group of rare diseases that is characterized by common features of insidious painless, proximal skeletal muscle weakness, low endurance, and elevated serum muscle enzyme levels. Due to muscle weakness and progressive muscular atrophy, decreasing endurance, internal organ involvement (mainly given the pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations) and limited therapeutic options, IIM often leads to physical disability and decreased quality of life. Nipocalimab is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to selectively bind, saturate, and block the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding site on the endogenous neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) that binds, salvages, and recycles IgG into circulation or transport IgG across the placenta, following nonspecific pinocytosis into endothelial cells and cells of the reticuloendothelial system. At homeostasis, FcRn recycles IgG to maintain serum IgG levels and extend IgG half-life and also regulates immune cell inflammatory responses to IgG complexes. By targeting the IgG binding site on FcRn, nipocalimab is expected to block the binding and, hence, recycling of IgG, resulting in a decrease in circulating IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic IgG autoantibodies and alloantibodies. Therefore, nipocalimab has potential in the treatment of active IIM by decreasing pathogenic IgG antibody concentrations. The total duration of the study is up to 112 weeks, consisting of 4 study periods: a less than or equal to (<=) 6-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind period, a 48-week long term extension (LTE), and a safety follow-up 8 weeks post last administration of study intervention.

The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation.

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.

Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis.

CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel.

About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.

The study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

The goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

Eight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.",,INT - Procedure/Surgery,Adults,,,"Forty percent of pregnant women in the United States are women who have never given birth. As a group, they sometimes have complications with their pregnancy, but there is no information from a previous pregnancy to identify who might have a problem. Very little research has been done with this group. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is collecting data from a diverse population of about 10,000 women who are having their first baby and are carrying only one baby. The women are enrolled early in pregnancy and undergo research assessments four times during their pregnancies. Data are collected through interviews, self-completed data forms, clinical measurements, ultrasound, and collection and storage of blood samples, urine samples, and fluid from the vagina and cervix. Some information comes from medical records. A subset of women may be asked to participate in substudies collecting information on sleep breathing, sleep patterns and quality, or other areas possibly related to birth outcomes. The goal of the research is to find ways to identify women in this group who might develop a problem with their pregnancy and use this information to improve the health of pregnant women and their babies in the future. The study is focusing on pregnancy problems like high blood pressure, babies that are born much too early and very small babies.",2023-05-10T10:05:59,SOM/Obstetrics and Gynecology,"Pregnancy, Womens Health  OB/GYN",National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,,

The hypothesis of the study is that occurrence of remifentanil-induced HI group.",II,INT - Drug,Adults,,,"Opioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. [1-4] Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.

This research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH.  By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.",2023-05-10T10:05:27,SOM/Anesthesiology,"Hyperalgesia, Anesthesia",Department of Anesthesiology,,
